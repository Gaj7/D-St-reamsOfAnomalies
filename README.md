# D(St)reams of Anomalies

## EECS 731: Introduction to Data Science, project 6.

In this project, I investigate a fraction of the NAB data suite. Specifically, I look at real data about traffic in the Twin Cities Metro, collected by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, and attempt to identify outliers. To do so, I apply scikit learn's implementation of the isolation forest algorithm. The dataset does not label any data as anomalous, so evaluating my success is difficult, but I argue via visualization that the results are reasonable and intuitive.

If you are running the notebook locally, refer to `requirements.md` for a list of prerequisite python packages.
